* DBUtils: Provides methods for querying a database (e.g., finding users or items) using JDBC.
* SessionHeader: Represents a session header with username and session ID attributes.
* Utils: Offers various utility methods for generating keys, deleting files, executing JavaScript code, and encrypting data.
* WebUtils: Handles cookie management and retrieves the current session ID from an HTTP request.

**Key Components (Functions, Classes, Modules):**

1. DBUtils:
	* `DBUtils` class with constructor that establishes a database connection using JDBC.
	* `findUsers` method for retrieving users based on username.
	* `findItem` method for finding items by item ID.
2. SessionHeader:
	* `SessionHeader` class implementing the `Serializable` interface.
	* Constructor initializes attributes (username and session ID).
	* Getter and setter methods for accessing attributes.
3. Utils:
	* `generateKey` method generates a key pair using RSA algorithm.
	* `deleteFile` method deletes a file using Apache Commons IO.
	* `executeJs` method executes JavaScript code using ScriptEngine.
	* `encrypt` method encrypts data using AES-GCM algorithm (noncompliant as it is not properly initialized).
4. WebUtils:
	* `addCookie` method adds a cookie to an HTTP response.
	* `getSessionId` method retrieves the current session ID from an HTTP request and sends it over a socket connection.

**Interaction or Execution Flow:**

The components interact with each other in the following ways:

1. DBUtils:
	* Establishes a database connection in its constructor.
	* Uses this connection to execute queries (e.g., `findUsers` and `findItem`) methods.
2. SessionHeader:
	* No direct interaction with other components, but is used as an object instance in the code.
3. Utils:
	* Generates keys for encryption.
	* Deletes files using Apache Commons IO.
	* Executes JavaScript code using ScriptEngine.
4. WebUtils:
	* Adds cookies to HTTP responses.
	* Retrieves session IDs from HTTP requests and sends them over a socket connection.

**Notable Inputs or Outputs:**

Some notable inputs and outputs in the code include:

1. DBUtils:
	* Usernames and item IDs for querying the database.
2. SessionHeader:
	* Username and session ID attributes.
3. Utils:
	* Keys, file paths, JavaScript input, and encrypted data.
4. WebUtils:
	* Cookies (name-value pairs), HTTP requests, and socket connections.
