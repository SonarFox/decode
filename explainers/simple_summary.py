def explain(base_explanation, **kwargs):

    Provides the 'Simple Summary' explanation.

    For this format, we assume the base explanation obtained from the LLM
    is already a suitable summary and return it directly.

    Args:
        base_explanation (str): The initial explanation text obtained from the LLM.
        **kwargs: Accepts other potential arguments (like llm_client, model_name,
                  original_code) which might be needed by more complex explainers,
                  but ignores them here.

    Returns:
        str: The base_explanation string, unchanged.
